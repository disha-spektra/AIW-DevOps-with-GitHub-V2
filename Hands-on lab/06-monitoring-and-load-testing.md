# Exercise 4: Monitoring and Load Testing

### Estimated Duration: 120 minutes

## Scenario

You are part of the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team at Contoso Traders, responsible for ensuring application performance, availability, and resilience in the cloud environment. In this exercise, you will monitor application health and usage metrics using Azure Application Insights, perform load testing to evaluate scalability under simulated traffic, and explore Azure Chaos Studio to test how the application responds to real-world failures. 

These activities help validate system reliability, improve performance monitoring, and strengthen operational resilience.

## Overview

In this exercise, we will add monitoring and logging to gain insight on the application's usage in the cloud. Then create Azure load testing, which is a fully managed load-testing service that enables you to generate high-scale loads. The service simulates traffic for your applications, regardless of where they're hosted. Developers, testers, and quality assurance (QA) engineers can use it to optimise application performance, scalability, or capacity. We will also explore Azure Chaos Studio, which helps you measure, understand, and improve your cloud application and service resilience.

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will perform:

- Task 1: Monitoring using Application Insights
- Task 2: Set up Load Testing
- Task 3: Explore Chaos Studio

## Task 1: Monitoring using Application Insights

This task focuses on using Azure Application Insights to monitor the health and performance of the Contoso Traders application. You will review various monitoring metrics over a chosen time range.

1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to **contoso-traders-<inject key="Deploymentid" enableCopy="false" />** **(1)** resource group and select the **Application Insights** resource with the name **contoso-traders-ai<inject key="Deploymentid" />** **(2)**.

1. From the **Overview** of **contoso-traders-ai<inject key="Deploymentid"  enableCopy="false" />** Application Insights resource, you can set the **Show data for last** as per your requirement of monitoring insights.

   ![](media/E4T1S2.png)

1. In the first graph, you can see the number of **Failed requests** for the Application access.

   ![](media/E4T1S3.png)

1. In the next graph, you can see the average **Server response time**.

## Task 2: Set up Load Testing

In this task, you'll create an Azure Load Testing instance and run a test using a JMeter file.

1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to **contoso-traders-<inject key="Deploymentid" enableCopy="false" />** resource group and select the **Front Door** resource with the name **contoso-traders-cdn<inject key="Deploymentid" />**.

   ![](media/lt.png)

1. From the overview of **contoso-traders-cdn<inject key="Deploymentid" enableCopy="false" />** CDN, copy the **Endpoint hostname** and paste it into the notepad for later use in the task.

   ![](media/lt-2.png)

1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to **contoso-traders-<inject key="Deploymentid" enableCopy="false" />** **(1)** resource group and select the **Azure Load Testing** resource with the name **contoso-traders-loadtest<inject key="Deploymentid" />** **(2)**.

   ![](media/E4T2S3.png)

1. On the left hand side pane, select **Tests** **(1)** under **Tests** section and click on **+ Create** **(2)** and choose **Create a URL-based test** **(3)**.

   ![](media/E4T2S4.png)

1. On the **Create a URL-based test** page, under the **Basics** tab, leave all fields as default and click on **Next** to continue.

1. On the **Test plan** **(1)** page, click on **+ Add request** **(2)**, paste the **Endpoint URL** into the **URL** field **(3)**, leave all other settings as default, and then click **Add** **(4)**.

   ![](media/E4T2S6-1.png)

   >**Note**: Include "**https://**" at the starting of the URL, and paste the **Endpoint URL**.

   ![](media/lt-4.png)

1. Click on **Review + create** and click on **Create**.

1. The test run will start running, and once the test run is completed, you will be able to see **Client-side metrics**. Explore the given metrics output.

   >**Note**: It will take 20 minutes for the test to complete.

   ![](media/E4T2S8-1.png)

   **Note**: In case the test fails due to `The test was stopped due to a high error rate. Check your script and try again. In case the issue persists, raise a ticket with a support error`. This is expected as sometimes the load on the application exceeds the defined throughput.

>**Congratulations** on completing the Task! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:
 
> - Hit the Validate button for the corresponding task. If you receive a success message, you have successfully validated the lab.
