# DevOps with GitHub 

### Overall Estimated Duration: 8 Hours

## Lab Scenario

A retail company, Contoso Traders, wants to modernize its application delivery process by implementing DevOps practices using GitHub and Azure services. The development team needs to build and deploy .NET-based microservices, automate CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, and integrate Azure Boards for project tracking and testing. To improve application security and reliability, the organization also plans to enable GitHub Advanced Security features, perform load testing, monitor application performance using Application Insights, and simulate failures using Azure Chaos Studio. 

This lab helps participants gain hands-on experience in automating deployments, securing repositories, monitoring cloud applications, and validating system resilience in a real-world DevOps environment.


## Lab Overview

In this Hands-on lab, you will set up local infrastructure using .NET and work with the application's carts, products, and UI components. The infrastructure will be deployed to the cloud using GitHub Actions, with automation for updating and republishing workflows. You’ll explore Azure Boards, Test Plans, and GitHub Enterprise security features such as Code scanning, CodeQL alerts, and Dependabots. Additionally, the lab covers implementing monitoring, logging, Azure load testing, and Azure Chaos Studio to improve application resilience and performance.

## Objectives

Set up CI/CD with GitHub, integrate Azure Boards, enable GitHub security, run load tests, explore Chaos Studio and monitor performance.

- **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment:** You will be able to access the lab files, set up the local infrastructure, create a project repository, build and push the code using GitHub Actions, and edit the GitHub workflow file within Codespaces.
- **Azure Boards and Test Plans:** Connect Azure Boards with GitHub to enhance project tracking, and link GitHub pull requests to Boards items, enabling seamless integration between code development and project management workflows.
- **Explore GitHub's advanced security features:** Enable code scanning with CodeQL alerts, configure repository security advisories, utilize Dependabot for dependency management, and explore secret scanning to enhance repository security.
- **Monitoring and Load Testing:** Monitor application performance using Application Insights, set up load testing to evaluate system scalability, and explore Chaos Studio to simulate real-world failures for improving system resilience.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have basic knowledge and understanding of the following:

- Azure Portal navigation and resource management
- Fundamental knowledge of web applications and endpoints
- Basic familiarity with cloud monitoring and performance testing tools

## Architecture

In this lab, the architecture emphasizes integrating DevOps practices, security tooling, and performance engineering into the application development lifecycle. You will set up the local infrastructure, create a GitHub repository, and configure Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using GitHub Actions within GitHub Codespaces. Azure Boards and Test Plans are connected to GitHub to streamline project tracking and ensure traceability between development tasks and code changes.

To strengthen code security, GitHub’s advanced features such as CodeQL code scanning, Dependabot alerts, repository security advisories, and secret scanning are enabled to identify and remediate vulnerabilities early in the development process. Application performance is monitored using Azure Application Insights, while Azure Load Testing simulates user traffic to evaluate system scalability. Azure Chaos Studio is used to inject controlled failures, helping validate the application’s resilience under fault conditions.

## Explanation of the Components

- **Application Insights:** A monitoring tool that provides real-time performance and usage analytics for applications.
- **Azure Container Apps:** A fully managed service to build and deploy microservices and containerized applications with ease.
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):** A managed container orchestration service that simplifies deploying, managing, and scaling Kubernetes clusters.
- **Azure Cosmos DB:** A globally distributed, fully managed NoSQL database service designed for scalable, high-performance applications.
- **GitHub:** A cloud-based platform for version control and collaboration, enabling developers to manage, share, and collaborate on code projects using Git.
