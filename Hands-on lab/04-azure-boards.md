# Exercise 2: Azure Boards and Test Plans

### Estimated Duration: 120 Minutes

## Scenario

You are part of the DevOps team at Contoso Traders, where efficient project tracking and quality assurance are critical to delivering reliable application updates. In this exercise, you will connect Azure Boards with GitHub to streamline work item management and improve collaboration between developers and testers. 

You will also configure Azure Test Plans to create, execute, and monitor manual test cases, ensuring application features are validated before deployment.

## Overview

In this exercise, you'll explore Azure boards and Azure test plans. Azure Boards provides software development teams with the interactive and customizable tools they need to manage their software projects. Azure Test Plans provides rich and powerful tools that everyone in the team can use to drive quality and collaboration throughout the development process. The easy-to-use, browser-based test management solution provides all the capabilities required for planned manual testing.
